problem being presented: 12882 city park 
thought process : so i need to find the stone group with the highest combined area and display that area

first i need to know how to read in the data and put the points on to a "graph"()
then put the stones on the graph and see which ones that shouldbe  in the group together
if they are in a group then add theeir respective areas together and print that area = W X H
