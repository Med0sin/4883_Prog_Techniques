easy brezzy problem 
in this problem we attempt to solve the probelm of parity : We define the parity of an integer n as the sum of the bits in binary representation computed modulo two. As an example,
 the number 21 = 101012 has three 1s in its binary representation so it has parity 3(mod2), or 1.
In this problem you have to calculate the parity of an integer 1 ≤ I ≤ 2147483647.

pretty easy problem
