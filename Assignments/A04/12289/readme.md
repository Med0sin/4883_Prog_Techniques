easy brezzy problem
Your little brother has just learnt to write one, two and three, in English. He has written a lot of those words in a paper, your task is to recognize them. Note that your little brother is only a child, so he may make small mistakes: for each word, there might be at most one wrong letter. The word length is always correct. It is guaranteed that each letter he wrote is in lower-case, and each word he wrote has a unique interpretation.
