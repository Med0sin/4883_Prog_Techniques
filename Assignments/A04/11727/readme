easy brezzy problem 
Cutting costs: They have got three (3) employees working in the accounts department and are going to lay-off two (2) of them. After a series of meetings, they have decided to dislodge the person who gets the most salary and the one who gets the least. This is usually the general trend during crisis like this.
You will be given the salaries of these 3 employees working in the accounts department. You have to find out the salary of the person who survives.
