/This Hashmat is a brave warrior who with his group of young soldiers moves from one place to another to fight against his opponents. Before Fighting he just calculates one thing, 
the difference between his soldier number and the opponent’s soldier number. From this difference he decides whether to fight or not. Hashmat’s soldier number is never greater than his opponent 
This is a absolute value problem.

pretty simple problem didnt really have problem coming up with a solution but needed help finding a way to implement the solution in had in mind
